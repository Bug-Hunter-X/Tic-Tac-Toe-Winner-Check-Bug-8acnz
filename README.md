This repository contains a bug report and solution for a Tic-Tac-Toe Dapp. The bug is related to the winner checking function which fails to correctly identify diagonal wins.  The solution provides a corrected version of the function.  This is a common issue encountered in game development due to off-by-one errors or edge cases not being considered fully. This is particularly relevant in decentralized applications where bugs can have significant financial or security implications.
